This file contains the code that was ran to generate data used in the paper and the referenced Google Docs. We have also attached all of the relevant plots discussed in the paper and the supplementary document.

SimTouch_application.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code. We encourage the reviewers to run the code themselves to confirm the validity of our findings.

/afferent plots : contains the afferent maps for various stimulation conditions
	
	1x/3x amp implies the factor used to scale the stimulation amplitudes when simulation afferent responses
	02/12 indent refers to 0.2 or 1.2mm indentation
	standard/nodyn/nostat refer to type of skin model used in TS software. standard = standard TS model. nodyn = wave propagation turned off. nostat = static deformation due to pins is turned off. 

/rate code results : contains files associated with rate. Info in these files is in plot 5 in the paper.

/temporal code results : contains correlation plots, parameters plots, and correlation histograms for temporal variance plotted against roughness for various TS models 


/spatial code results : contains correlation plots, parameters plots, and correlation histograms for spatial variance plotted against roughness for various TS models
