This file contains the code that was run to generate data used in the paper and
the referenced Google Docs.

SimTouch_application.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code.
We encourage the reviewers to run the code themselves to confirm the validity of
our findings.

convolution_spatial, convoluation_temporal, rate_code are pickle files that
are loaded up in the code. They contain simulations and convolution results.
These files can be generated by the attached code but it takes 1-2 hours to do so.

/afferent_plots contains all of the plots in Figure 5A in the paper as well as
those omitted for simplicity.

/temporal_code contains plots of temporal variation plotted vs roughness judgements

/spatial_code contains plots of spatial variation plotted vs roughness judgements

/spatial_code_norm_count contains plots of spatial variation normalized by number
of engaged afferents plotted vs roughness judgements

/spatial_code_norm_rate contains plots of spatial variation normalized by
sum total affernt spike count averaged in time plotted vs roughness judgements

video0, video1, video2 are gif files that show how the stimulus is positioned
along the skin in the simulation and its progression in time
