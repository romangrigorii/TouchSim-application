This file contains the code that was ran to generate data used in the paper and the referenced Google Docs. We have also attached all of the relevant plots discussed in the paper and the supplementary document.

SimTouch_application.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code. We encourage the reviewers to run the code themselves to confirm the validity ofour findings.

convolution_spatial, convoluation_temporal, rate_code are pickle files that are generated by the attached code and are also used by certain section of the code to load up data for plotting. They contain simulations and convolution results.

/afferent_plots_1xamp_12indent contains all of the plots in Figure 5A in the paper as well as those we omitted for simplicity for sims computed at 1x amplitude of what was used in the experiment and 1.2mm indentaiton

/afferent_plots_3xamp_02indent contains all of the plots for sims computed at 3x amplitude of what was used in the experiment and 0.2mm indentaiton

/afferent_plots_3xamp_12indent contains all of the plots for sims computed at 1x amplitude of what was used in the experiment and 1.2mm indentaiton

/temporal_code contains plots of temporal variation plotted vs roughness judgements

/spatial_code_1xamp_12indent contains plots of spatial variation plotted vs roughness judgements for sims computed at 1x amplitude of what was used in the experiment and 1.2mm indentaiton

/spatial_code_3xamp_12indent contains plots of spatial variation plotted vs roughness judgements for sims computed at 3x amplitude of what was used in the experiment and 1.2mm indentaiton

/spatial_code_norm_count contains plots of spatial variation normalized by number of engaged afferents plotted vs roughness judgements

/spatial_code_norm_rate contains plots of spatial variation normalized by sum total afferent spike count averaged in time plotted vs roughness judgements
